Why yet another bookmark manager?
---------------------------------
Because i was annoyed with the ~1300 bookmarks that i had on PinBoard, and NO free, open source application that i could use to quickly batch 'CRUD' them. Also, an excuse to create something with the amazing Starling [Feathers UI](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers).

Big fat disclaimer
------------------
Everything is provided AS-IS. Use this project in any way you wish, just not to bother me :) If you have a question i will be happy to answer but i will not feel obliged in any way. Also, i probably violated several conventions of AS3 or the Feathers UI so do not expect perfect Feathers-compliant theming and components :)
